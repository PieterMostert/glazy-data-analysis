# glazy-data-analysis

I'll be writing about my attempts to understand the published glazes in the Glazy database through the use of machine learning. At the moment, I've only posted the result of a clustering algorithm (K-means), followed by manually verifying that the glazes in each cluster do have a common origin, and that separate clusters aren't related, and splitting or combining them as necessary. The manual verification process is incomplete, however. I've posted the verified clusters here, and the unverified ones here.
